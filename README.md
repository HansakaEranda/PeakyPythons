Mobile Application Development module group project of year 2 semester 2

Now a day we are living in a world where everything is becoming digitalized, online ticket booking has become a convenient and efficient system thanks to online payment methods, in such an environment paying physical cash for a ticket has become an old-fashioned method already, therefore we have decided to introduce an online ticket booking system for the public bus transportations, ”SLbus” is an online ticket booking app developed for the Sri Lankan passengers that will provide the facility to book tickets for the needed bus, easily through your mobile phone.

So why would we need such an application? As mentioned earlier when the whole world is becoming digitalized, replacing ancient systems with modern technologies is only natural, providing an easy and efficient method in performing tasks is expected in everything, and also taking the current situation, where an global pandemic is still spreading nonstop, in public transportations we can limit the number of passengers by distancing them, but still there will be some physical contact when exchanging money, so such a problem will be minimized by an online payment method, where the passengers would need to just confirm their identity and purchase through an e-receipt when getting in the bus.
